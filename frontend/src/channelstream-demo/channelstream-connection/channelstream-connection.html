`<channelstream-connection>` allows you to connect and interact with channelstream server
abstracting websocket/long-polling connections from you.

In typical use, just slap some `<channelstream-connection>` at the top of your body:

    <body>
          <channelstream-connection
          username="{{user.username}}"
          connect-url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/connect"
          disconnect-url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/disconnect"
          subscribe-url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/subscribe"
          message-url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/message"
          long-poll-url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/listen"
          websocket-url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/ws"
          channels-url='["channel1", "channel2"]' />

Then you can do `channelstreamElem.connect()` to kick off your connection.
This element also handles automatic reconnections.

## Default handlers

By default element has a listener attached that will fire `startListening()` handler on `channelstream-connected` event.

By default element has a listener attached that will fire `retryConnection()` handler on `channelstream-connect-error` event,
this handler will forever try to re-establish connection to the server incrementing intervals between retries up to 1 minute.
